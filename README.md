# Project Template

Use this template to create a new game or astronomy/educational app in a realistic (or not realistic) solar system.

This "template" is not a game but has a game-like construction with a template splash screen, a "starter" game GUI (see below), a main menu, options & hotkeys popups, and save/load functionality with dialogs. Functionally, it is a solar system "viewer". Use it as a starting point to build any kind of game or app.

I, Voyager is free, open-source software built on the free, open-source [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org). It is designed to be improved, modified and extended by the community. Follow the links below for more information:

### Installation

Find more detailed instructions at our [Developers](https://www.ivoyager.dev/developers/) page.

To use this template, click the green "Use this template" button from the GitHub [repository page](https://github.com/ivoyager/project_template). GitHub will duplicate the template for you, prompting you to name your new project and set it to public or private.

Your new repository uses submodules! To clone using git:

`git clone --recursive git://github.com/your_account/your_new_project.git`

The editor plugin will manage assets download and version updates (assets are not Git-tracked). Just press 'Download' at the editor prompt.

After above steps, your addons directory will contain three subdirectories: `ivoyager_assets`, `ivoyager_core`, `ivoyager_tables`, `ivoyager_units` and `ivoyager_save`.

You can disable and remove the Save plugin if your application does not need game save functionality.

Authors, credits, and legal files in the project directory (AUTHORS.md, CREDITS.md, LICENCE.txt, 3RD_PARTY.md) are copied from the Core plugin (addons/ivoyager_core/). You should replace or delete these in your new project directory (it's your project and we're not authors!), but don't alter or delete these files in the plugin. Please do give us credit in your project!

It's not a "game" but you can move the camera around the solar system. The template GUI was thrown together rather quickly (literally in minutes) using widgets from [a large set of 47](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_core/tree/master/ui_widgets) developed for the [Planetarium](https://www.ivoyager.dev/planetarium/). The Project Template also has a template splash screen, a main menu, options & hotkeys popups, and save/load functionality with dialogs.
